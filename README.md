Firstly, huge thanks to the author Hans, with a super helpful and informative post on NeoPixel and FastLed Code and examples. This project would not be of this scale without his article.

All code is free to use and be modified.

I recomend adding code to make it controllable from your Android/ iOS smart phone or tablet.
if you wish to modify code as such, it is my request that you also send the code to me, as i would like to upgrade this small project.

inspiration to create this. 
The rainbow effect.

More updates and modifications are on the way.
